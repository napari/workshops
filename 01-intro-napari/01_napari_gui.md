# The napari application

## About napari

**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for scientific
data analysis in Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analysing
large multi-dimensional images. napari is free and open source, built and
maintained by an international community of scientists and developers.

For full documentation of the napari viewer, see the
[Viewer tutorial](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/viewer.html).
Here we give a practical overview.


napari supports several **layer types** for different kinds of data:

For this workshop we will focus on **Image**, **Labels**, **Points**, **Shapes**,and
 layers, though you may explore some examples using other layer types.
 For a complete guide to all layer types, see the
[napari layer guides](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/index.html).


## Launch napari

If you installed using the bundled app, launch napari from your Applications folder (macOS),
Start menu (Windows), or desktop shortcut (Linux) — just like any other application.

```{code-cell}
import napari
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot
viewer = napari.Viewer()
nbscreenshot(viewer)
```


```{tip} Slow launch?
The first launch can take up to a minute if your computer has security or antivirus software
running. Subsequent launches are faster.
```

## Open an Image

- Open a sample image that comes with napari by selecting:
  **File** > **Open Sample** > **napari builtins** > **Cells (3D + 2Ch)**
- Open one of your own images with:  
  **File** > **Open files** and select a tif, png, or jpg file to open—or drag-n-drop one onto
the canvas.

```{tip} The command palette
You can search actions in the command palette, which you can open with the `Control+Shift+P` (Windows and Linux) or `Command+Shift+P` (Mac). Search for 'Cells 3D' to open the sample image.
```

```{note} File formats
By default, napari can open (and save) a wide range of non-proprietary file formats. For proprietary image formats, you will need to install an appropriate plugin. You can search the [napari-hub](https://napari-hub.org) to find one!
```

## Explore Images in 2D and 3D  

- Toggle layer visibility on and off with the **eye button to the left of the layer name** in the layer list.
- Use the dimension sliders beneath the canvas to  control the z position/slice number. Slide through the 3D stack one 2D slice at a time.
- Scroll (use two finger scroll on a touchpad) to zoom in and out.
- Click and drag to move the images in the canvas.

- Press the `home` button to bring the image back to the center of the canvas.  
![home button](https://napari.org/stable/_images/button-right-click-indicator.png)  
It is on the right end of the row of viewer buttons.  

- Explore images in 3D by toggling the `2D/3D` button.  When you're in 2D mode, it looks like this:  
![2d-3d-button](resources/2d-3d-button-2d.png)  
When you're in 3D mode, it looks like this:  
![2d-3d-button-3d](resources/2d-3d-button-3d.png)  
It is second from the left end on the row of viewer buttons.
- Click and drag on the 3D image to rotate.
- Shift + click and drag to translate (move) the 3D image.  
- Scroll to zoom in and out of the 3D volume.
- Move the _nuclei_ and _membrane_ images to be side-by-side by toggling the `grid mode` button; it's the second button from the right end on the row of viewer buttons and acts as a toggle. 
![grid-button](resources/grid-button.png)  
 
## Adjust Image Visualization   
- Select an image from the layers list (selected images are blue in the layer list).  
- Adjust the contrast limits by using the contrast limits slider in the layer controls section.

    ```{tip} You can Control+click (Mac) or right-click (Windows and Linux) on the slider to open the expanded view with min and max pixel values labeled on the ends of the slider.

    ```  
* Adjust opacity, color map, and blending modes in the layer controls section.  

## Explore Stack Manipulation  
* Select both the nuclei and membrane layers in the layer list using shift+click.
* Control+click (Mac)/right-click (Windows and Linux) either of the selected layers to open the layer actions menu. 


    ```{note}
    The layer actions menu is contextually aware, so it will have different options enabled depending on the
    layer(s) that is selected.
    ```

    * Merge layers:	
        * With both layers selected, click **Merge to Stack** to combine the **nuclei** and **membrane** layers to make a single layer with an additional slider that controls the channel axis.  
    * Rename this layer to **cells** by double clicking the layer in the layer list and replacing the text.  
    * Rename the dimension sliders at the bottom of the canvas to read **Ch** and **Z** by double clicking the **0** and **1** on the left side of the sliders and replacing the text.  

    * Explore the data using the sliders.  
    * Open the layer action menu and split the stacks with the **Split Stack** command.  

        ```{note}
        **Split Stack** divides a layer in its *first listed dimension*, which would have index `0` and should be represented by the bottom-most slider. In this case, selecting the newly merged layer will separate the channels into separate layers. Meanwhile, applying **Split Stack** to one of the resulting layers will split the layer into a set of 2D layers for each of the z slices.

        ```

## Explore the Labels layer

* Add a labels layer using the third button from the left above the layers list.
    * This layer will be blank to begin with. 
    * With the new Labels layer selected, find the paintbrush button at the top of the layer controls.
    * Paint some labels on your image. Change the colour (and by extension, integer ID of the label) using the spinner in the layer controls.
* Re-order the layer list by dragging a selected layer in the list below another. Depending on the blending and opacity settings, this will change the visualization!

```{tip}
You can delete layers selected individually using the trash can icon or by pressing the backspace key.
Delete all layers in the layer list by selecting one layer, and then pressing Command+A (Mac) / Control+A (Windows and Linux) to select all layers. Then click the trash can button on the top right of the layer list. 

```

The Points and Shapes layers can also be used for annotating you image layers and are accessible 
through the GUI buttons. Additional data layers (Surfaces, Tracks, and Vectors) are available through 
the API. For guides to using the various layer types, please see the [napari layer guides](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/index.html).

## Save your data

There are two options for saving your data: saving the layers themselves or saving the rendered view
in the canvas. 

To save the currently rendered view, use the File menu **Save Screenshot**. You can also choose to include

the viewer or to save the screenshot to the clipboard instead of a file.

You can save the layers individually using the File menu or Command+S (Mac) / Control+S (Windows and Linux). 

* For image layers, you can select the file type by providing the extension.
Note: Some formats may not work for all image types, e.g. 3D stacks. Additional file types
can be made available by plugins.
* Points and Shapes layers are saved as `.csv` files that contain their coordinates.
* Labels layers are saved as `.tiff` files.

Multiple different layer types, e.g. image and points, can be saved to a single `.svg` file,
which can be convenient for use in a vector graphics program or for web.

* Select more than one layer and use the File menu or Command+S (Mac) / Control+S (Windows and Linux),
  then in the dialog dropdown menu ensure `napari SVG` is selected, give the file a name, and save.

Finally, you can save a screenshot of the canvas (where the data is) and the viewer with
the respective "Save Screenshot" option in the file menu.
This is useful for sharing the current rendered view of the data. If you want to export the full visualized data,
you can also use the `viewer.export_figure()` method which will adjust the canvas to fit the extents of the data
and save a screenshot of the canvas. You can compare `viewer.screenshot()` and `viewer.export_figure()` in
this [gallery example](https://napari.org/stable/gallery/screenshot_and_export_figure.html).

    ```{important} 
    The output file will not be openable in napari!
    ```

Perhaps more usefully, multiple different layer types, e.g. image and points, can be saved as
individual layers (as described above) *to a folder.* 
* Select more than one layer and use the File menu or Command+S (Mac) / Control+S (Windows and Linux) or use Command+Option+S (Mac) / Control+Alt+S (Windows and Linux) to save all layers. Then in the dialog dropdown menu change `napari-svg` to `napari builtins Save to Folder`. Enter a folder name and hit save. A new folder with that name will be created and the files will be individually exported there, as noted above.

    ```{important} 
    To re-open the files, open the enclosing folder, select all the files, and drag-n-drop them on the napari canvas. At present, opening the folder directly, if it contains a mix of layer types, will not work—only images are supported in this way. Note that a folder of images will be imported as a stack.
    ```

## Use the integrated Python console to interact with the viewer

```{admonition} I (instructor peek)
:class: tip
Briefly show the console exists and that it mirrors the GUI state. This is
not the focus of this workshop — keep it short. A full Python introduction is
in the next workshop in the series.
```

```{tip}
You may want to delete any unneeded layers and/or re-open the Cells3D sample file.
```

* Open the integrated console with the first button on the row of the viewer control buttons.  
![console-button](resources/console-button.png)

    ```{important}
    The integrated Python console is only available if napari was started from a non-interactive session, meaning the terminal (using `napari`) or a script. If you are already in an interactive session, like iPython or a notebook, keep using that!
    ```
* Get the layer list programmatically; enter:

    ```python
    viewer.layers
    ```

* Adjust the scale of an image. If you have just the `nuclei` and `membrane` image layers, you can provide micron to pixel scale information for the `nuclei` layer as follows:

    ```Python
    viewer.layers['nuclei'].scale = [0.35, 0.2, 0.2]
    ```

Alternatively, you could use the index of the layer instead. 

* If you want to change the scale of all layers, enter the following commands one line at a time, ensuring an indent on the second line, as shown below: 

    ```python
    for layer in viewer.layers:  
        layer.scale = [0.35, 0.2, 0.2]
    ```

```{important} 
If your layers disappeared, you will need to click the `home` button to reset the viewer and you may need to adjust the slider to a new slice
```

* Add a scale bar using the GUI **View** > **Scale Bar** > **Scale Bar Visible** or by typing 

`viewer.scale_bar.visible = True`  in the integrated console. 
* Add physical units of microns to the scale bar by typing `viewer.scale_bar.unit = "um"`  
in the integrated console.
* Try zooming in and out of the image, while watching the scale bar!

````{tip}
The integrated console is a full-featured iPython kernel. You can use it for interactive
analysis, just import `numpy` or `skimage`. You can use `tab` for auto-completions and the Up
arrow to access the command history. Use a `?` to access documentation, e.g.

    
```
viewer?
```

````

## The Preferences/Settings

Here you can customize the behavior of napari, e.g. keybindings, as well as
the look (e.g. themes).
* Access the Settings on Windows/Linux in the **File** menu or the Preferences in the **napari** menu on macOS
![Preferences/Settings window](resources/preferences.png)
    * Be sure and check the extensive, editable keyboard shortcuts!

```{note}
- Preferences/Settings are stored *per Python environment*. 
- They can reset using `napari --reset` in the terminal
```

## You — Personal Exploration

```{admonition} You (free exploration)
:class: seealso
Take 10–15 minutes to explore napari on your own. Suggestions below — pick
whatever looks interesting. There is no wrong answer.
```

**Option A — Gallery drag-and-drop (napari 0.7.0+)**

Browse the [napari gallery](https://napari.org/stable/gallery) and find an
example that looks interesting to you.

1. Click the example to open its page, then use the **Download this file**
   link (or the GitHub link) to download the `.py` script.
2. Drag the `.py` file directly onto the napari canvas.
3. See what happens!

```{tip}
**New in napari 0.7.0:** Gallery scripts can be dragged directly into napari
and they will run immediately. If you are using napari 0.6.6, open a terminal,
navigate to the downloaded file, and run `python script_name.py` instead.
```

**Option B — Open your own data**

If you have an image file (`.tif`, `.png`, `.jpg`, or any other format) on
your computer, drag it onto the napari canvas and explore.

**Option C — Continue experimenting with Cells 3D**

- Merge the nuclei and membrane channels, rename the sliders, then split them again
- Paint some labels over a nucleus
- Save a screenshot of your best view (**File > Save Screenshot**)

After the exploration time, we will come back to the main room for a brief
sharing round: *"What did you find or try?"*
